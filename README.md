#Twitter clone
==================

This is my seventh week challenge at Makers Academy.

It's a clone of Twitter interface. 

The Challenge
-----------

Reimplement the Twitter.com feed page as close as possible to the real look and feel. 

The goal of this exercise is to test your front-end skills. You are expected to produce only HTML, CSS and JS files.Do not build a Sinatra application.

Goal 1. Make sure it looks good on the desktop. As a minimum you should have the header and the list of tweets.

Goal 2. Add JavaScript for infinite scrolling (using dummy data, no server-side at all), expanding the tweet input box on focus and, if you're feeling adventurous, a popup to add a new tweet.

Don't forget the infinite scrolling adds a spinner to show that data is being loaded. Even though you'll be using dummy data, emulate the delay.

Goal 3. Make it responsive. 

Technologies used
-----------
For the completion of this project I used the following technologies:

* HTML5
* CSS3
* JavaScript
* jQuery
* Ajax
* Twitter API
